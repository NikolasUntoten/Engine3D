Curious about the internal workings of 3D rendering engines, I decided to develop my own. I focused on creating my own algorithms, slowly figuring out how each component works on my own. This is not meant to be a released product (there's no way I could compete with the engines that are already on the market), but more of a learning experience for myself.

The main focus of this project was to test the algorithm I developed for rendering 3D points to a 2D screen.
